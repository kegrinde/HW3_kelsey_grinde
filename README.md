Third homework for BIOST 578A, due March 2

The goal of this homework is to reproduce the results in Figure 2 in:

Qian, F., Bolen, C. R., Jing, C., Wang, X., Zheng, W., Zhao, H., et al. (2013). Impaired toll-like receptor 3-mediated immune responses from macrophages of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Clinical and Vaccine Immunology : CVI, 20(2), 146â€“155. doi:10.1128/CVI.00530-12

To do so, we will need to:

1. Get the data from GEO
2. Normalize the data (if necessary)
3. Use limma to test for differential expression
4. Display the results using a heatmap [Hint: Use the pheatmap package]
